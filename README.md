<h3>E-Commerce Web Application</h3>
<p>This GitHub repository is used for the creation of an e-commerce web application for books. The goal of this project is to develop an online store that allows users to browse and purchase books, track their orders, and manage their account information. </p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>The e-commerce web application will be developed using the Django web framework, which provides a robust and flexible platform for building web applications. This framework enables rapid development and follows a modular and navigable design approach.</p>

<h3>Programming Languages</h3>

<p>Python will be used to build the backend of the web application, while HTML will be utilized for website layout and design. CSS will be used for website styling, and JavaScript will be implemented to add interactive features to the user interface.</p>

<h3>Other Technologies</h3>

<p>The website may also incorporate other technologies such as Ajax, Bootstrap, and JQuery to improve the user experience and functionality of the application. These technologies will be used to enhance the performance, responsiveness, and user interface of the web application, while also ensuring that it is mobile-friendly and accessible across different platforms and devices.</p>
