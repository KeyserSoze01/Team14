Appendix B: Analysis Models

1. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
    A visual representation of the flow of data through the e-commerce web app, including inputs, processes, and outputs. This helps to understand the system's architecture and data relationships.
2. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
    A diagram that represents the relationships between entities in the e-commerce web app, including books, users, and reviews. This helps to understand the database structure and how data is stored and retrieved.
3. Class Diagram

4. State-Transition Diagram
    A diagram that represents the different states that a book or user can be in and the events that cause transitions between those states. This helps to understand the system's behavior and logic.

The actual models will be produced next
